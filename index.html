      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        "Everyone is Happy, Everyone is Laughing" is a hauntingly beautiful piano album, echoing the
        delicate balance between life and death, joy and sorrow. Every note is a reflection, a
        soulful meditation on the ephemeral nature of existence, echoing the bittersweet symphony of
        our lives surrounded by the inevitable embrace of mortality. Can happiness flourish in the
        shadow of death? This album explores such profound inquiries, unraveling the complexities of
        emotions amidst the omnipresent spectre of our mortality.
      </p>
      <p>
        The album is an intimate journey into the soulâ€™s deepest recesses, where the melodies echo
        the laughter and joy, underscoring the vitality of the present moment amidst the unyielding
        certainty of our end. The piano's resonating notes conjure a world where the beauty of life
        and the certainty of death intertwine, giving rise to reflections that are as profound as
        they are haunting. It questions if perhaps, in the fleeting light of our existence, there
        lies an opportunity to embrace joy with unwavering courage, to laugh in the face of the
        unyielding silence that awaits us.
